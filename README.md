# MiniEmbed: Tiny, Powerful Embedding Models from Scratch

**MiniEmbed** is a research-grade toolkit for training and deploying ultra-compact text embedding models (Bi-Encoders) built entirely from scratch in PyTorch. While the industry chases billion-parameter giants, MiniEmbed proves that a **~42 MB / 10.8M parameter** model can deliver production-grade semantic intelligence for specialized domains.

## What Can MiniEmbed Do?

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Semantic Search** | Find meaning, not just keywords. Understands that *"kitten"* is similar to *"cat"*. |
| **Re-Ranking** | Sort candidates by true semantic relevance. Eliminates false positives. |
| **Clustering** | Group thousands of texts into logical categories automatically. |
| **Product Matching** | Match identical items across stores, even with messy or inconsistent titles. |
| **Text Encoding** | Convert any text into a dense 256-dimensional vector for downstream tasks. |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhandarisuraz/miniembed.git
cd miniembed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Use the Model

The pre-trained Mini model is included in `models/mini/`. Alternatively, you can load it directly from Hugging Face:

```python
from src.inference import EmbeddingInference

# Option A: From local files
model = EmbeddingInference.from_pretrained("models/mini")

# Option B: Direct from Hugging Face (auto-downloads)
model = EmbeddingInference.from_pretrained("surazbhandari/miniembed")
```

### 3. Try It Instantly
```python
from src.inference import EmbeddingInference

model = EmbeddingInference.from_pretrained("models/mini")

# Similarity
score = model.similarity("Machine learning is great", "AI is wonderful")
print(f"Similarity: {score:.4f}")  # 0.4287

# Semantic Search
docs = ["Python is great for AI", "I love pizza", "Neural networks learn patterns"]
results = model.search("deep learning frameworks", docs, top_k=2)
for r in results:
    print(f"  [{r['score']:.3f}] {r['text']}")
```

For full Hugging Face integration, ensure you have `huggingface_hub` installed:
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```

## Interactive Demo (`demo.py`)

A full-featured Streamlit dashboard for exploring the model's capabilities without writing code:

- **Similarity** -- Real-time cosine similarity between any two texts.
- **Semantic Search** -- Rank a custom document set against your query.
- **Clustering** -- Automatically categorize items using K-Means.
- **Text Encoding** -- Inspect raw 256-D vectors and their statistics.
- **CSV Matcher** -- Match records between two CSV files for deduplication or cross-platform product mapping.

```bash
streamlit run demo.py
```

## Architecture

MiniEmbed uses a **custom 4-layer Transformer encoder** built from scratch -- no HuggingFace, no pre-trained weights:

| Component | Specification |
|---|---|
| Embedding Dimension | 256 |
| Attention Heads | 4 |
| Transformer Layers | 4 |
| Feed-Forward Dimension | 1,024 |
| Vocabulary Size | 30,000 |
| Max Sequence Length | 128 tokens |
| Total Parameters | ~10.8M |
| Model Size on Disk | ~42 MB |
| Pooling Strategy | Mean Pooling + L2 Normalization |

### Training Objective

Training uses **Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss (MNRL)**, the industry-standard contrastive objective for Bi-Encoders:

$$\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log \frac{e^{sim(q_i, p_i) / \tau}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{sim(q_i, p_j) / \tau}}$$

All embeddings are **L2-normalized**, projecting text onto a unit hypersphere where cosine similarity equals dot product -- enabling ultra-fast nearest-neighbor search.

## Training Data Sources

The pre-trained model was trained on ~3.8 million text pairs from the following open-source datasets:

| Dataset | Type | Source |
